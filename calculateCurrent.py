    # along one possible path. There are infintely many possible paths. If we consider each possible path a resistor in paralell then
    # the total system resistance is given by $ 1/R_tot = 1/R_{M,1} + 1/R_{M,1} + 1/R_{M,2} + 1/R_{M,3} + ... $.
    # Thus the goal should be to compute this sum and then take the reciprical. This is simular to the problem of computing a partition
    # function for a system with infinite states; we can do it with monte-carlo methods. We do need to decide which paths contribute the most
    # to the final resistance. If we assume that there are $N$ total paths (the paths that we end up sampling) the the total resistence is 
    # this is the resistance along one possible path for the electron.
    # To simplify the number of paths to choose from we use the nearest neighbor model - i.e. the only path the matters is the path between the two closest particles.
    # Other paths will have a much lower change of beign taken. Thus we start with each particle; find the next closest with a higher x-value and so on.

    # One last note is that the tunneling probability should be additionally modified by the Boltzmann factor bias that
    # forces migration accordig to the voltage bias. This should allows us to see pulses in the current that mimic pulses in the voltage.
